        title: "Overview of East Asian Misconceptions",
        author: "NA",
        content: [
          "One common stereotype surrounding the East Asian countries is that the issues surrounding them don’t affect us U.S. citizens. Here are three case studies (out of many more) that prove this stereotype false. First, the East China Sea Conflict. Most of us Americans know that the Taliban, the civil wars in Syria and Libya, and the war against ISIS are all critical issues in U.S. foreign policy.  But many don’t know that territorial disputes in the East China Sea between China and Japan are just as high-stakes. Both Japan and China have declared economic rights in an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) 200 nautical miles wide, but these zones overlap as the sea is only 360 miles wide.  In addition, there have been ongoing squabbles between the two countries over a series of small islands called the Senkaku/Daioyu islands. Although leaders in both countries have been careful not to escalate the dispute, nationalism and mistrust among citizens on both sides make it possible that unauthorized military commanders on both sides could make the tension come to a head. In 2012, the U.S. congress declared that the islands fall under the  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, and thus that in the event of an attack by China the US would defend Japan. This occurrence could potentially get the U.S. entangled in a war with China, and is thus critical to U.S. foreign policy.",
          "Korean reunification provides another case study. Although North and South Korea may seem like defined countries on the world map, their existence as separate entities is more precarious than clear-cut lists and foreign policy documents reveal. In fact, the interests of foreign countries, particularly the U.S., have played a large role as to preventing Korea’s reunification. Today China uses North Korea as a physical buffer between it and the U.S. The U.S., on the other hand, has stationed thousands of troops in South Korea so as not to allow China’s power to expand unchecked. The U.S. is interested in preserving this stalemate – just as in the Cold War era, we don’t want to jeopardize our security by risking a unified, China-friendly Korea. In addition, if reunification occurred, South Korea and global powers would need to provide a projected $3 billion to aid North Korean reconstruction. As South Korea’s most powerful ally, the U.S. would likely be forced to supply some of the money, and this economic cost is yet another reason why Korean reunification is not an issue to cast off lightly.",
          "Kpop and J-cool comprise a third case study. At first glance, the waves of culture which currently emanate from South Korea and Japan (including manga, anime, soap operas, and Kpop and Jpop) may seem innocuous. But the U.S. must pay attention to this phenomenon. In recent years, the Korean and Japanese entertainment industries have become vastly popular. This popularity translates into economic power, as well as cultural, or “soft,” power. For example, Kpop both adds $2 billion a year to Korea’s economy and has helped to transform Korea’s global image over the past thirty years from a crude, uncivilized country to a modern, well-respected one. Although there are Western fans of manga and Kpop, the Korean and Japanese industries largely operate in Asia independently of the West: the primary consumers of these industries are China, Taiwan, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. If the West wants to possess both economic and soft power in Asia, we cannot overlook the cultural power of Japan and Korea."

        title: "China Censor’s Everything!!! Right?",
        author: "Dixon Layton",
        content: [
          "Because we live in a western country that enjoys many freedoms not universal to the world, we tend to think things about other countries based on some innate comparison to the experiences we have. This is neither unexpected nor bad, but it can get us into traps when thinking about countries that are fundamentally different than we are. China’s free speech and internet censorship policies are one of the easiest places to get caught up in western frames of mind, because the mindset in China regarding these topics seems irrational and crazy to us, despite it being perfectly normal in China.",
          "The most obvious area where we expect there to be issues is with free speech, because we always assume that in a country where that doesn’t exist, absolutely everyone who does will get taken in. That is simply not the case in China, where certain individuals--like the artist Ai Weiwei--have been actively trying to counter the government’s rhetoric. Of course, it is true that some of the most outspoken and revolutionary activists have been arrested, but on the whole that’s not the case, because the Chinese government has been very smart about this. They recognize that if they were to arrest their opponents in the most public way, then it would lead to problems, so in effect they just ignore them, and no one has a big enough following to make any revolution happen.",
          "Furthermore, the internet policies that China has put in place also seem tyrannical to those of us outside China, but within it, their view is very different. The young in China have never known a time when the internet wasn’t censored, and so they essentially don’t know there is something to miss. Because of the lack of western media and influence on the Chinese internet, and the replacement of the sites we know and love (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon) with equivalent sites in China (Baidu, renren.com, Weibo, Taobao), they have no real need to look for things outside of China’s borders. However, they could if they tried, and that is another misconception about China’s internet policy: that they try their hardest to make it impossible to see banned sites. In fact, it’s relatively easy to get on a foreign site in China, if you know what you’re doing. I don’t, so I can’t really explain it, but the Chinese government itself doesn’t particularly care if individuals gain access to the outside world, they can’t exactly stop them, and if a Chinese person travels and then accesses the internet, they can’t do anything. They live in a big enough country that individuals with banned information can’t do much, so they let it slide almost every time. They focus on closing the biggest holes, and then let their independent volunteer army of searchers, the “50 cent party,” find the rest. These are essentially regular citizens who find instances of infringements on the web, and alert overseers who made them. They are anonymous, and a rather Orwellian group, but are independent. They only report to the government, and in reality they don’t find all that much, because the majority of China self-censors their web content, because they have no reason to act out; as I said earlier, they grew up under the censorship, and don’t truly know the difference.",
          "Essentially, to understand the roots of free speech and internet censorship in China, we have to let go of the things we consider universal and given, because they don’t hold true all across the world. The chinese are not in the US and have a very different culture to what we have, and so without understanding that fact, their relationship to those two areas will not make sense. All of the evidence above draws from those ideas, that China is very very different from us, and that’s why they accept the censorship and restrictions on free speech."

        title: "WHY CHINA IS NOT TAKING OVER THE WORLD. CHINA IS KILLING US/CHINA IS RICHER THAN US",
        author: "Kevin Qiwei",
        content: [
          "China is not taking over the world and isn’t going to defeat the US or something - China currently has too much of its interests tied intimately together with its economics and so much of it is integrated into a global, modern-day economy that it risks imploding onto itself if it tries to do anything to upset the global status quo by too much. Most of China’s power is in its soft power in form of economy, not as much in military hard power. Despite frequent claims of Chinese military getting more and more powerful (which have a grain of truth to them), the Chinese military is still decidedly less powerful than that of the US. China is surrounded by countries aligned with the US (Japan, South Korea, Philippines for example) and is currently in the middle of a very difficult economic transition, so it’s got a lot of domestic issues to take care first. The Economist claimed that “It is a question of when, not if, real trouble will hit in China” with regards to a debt bust that it thinks China is going to have soon, showing that mainstream media also recognize the difficulties China is having with its economy (for further reference look at China’s stock market). There are many issues with the Chinese economy, and it may take only one of them to implode the Chinese market and send it into turmoil. Furthermore, the most recent incarnation of China’s government is also relatively young and untested, and it remains to be seen whether it can whether all kinds of challenges, such as world wars and major economic downturns and come out better than before.",
          "As for China getting richer than the US and all such hype, as of 2014 the US is 22.3% of world economy by GDP, while China is only 13.4%. It would take China a very long time, if ever, to catch up with and exceed the economic prowess of an established superpower. Minus all kinds of structural problems, such as increasingly inefficient state-run giants (the world’s top 4 biggest banks by asset are all state-run Chinese banks, and China’s “3 oil buckets” take up 2nd to 4th in the world by revenue), centralized command economy blocking market-orientated reforms and the debt/high-risk lending issues all across China, China still has a long way to go to surpass the US."

        title: "COMMUNISM/CAPITALISM IN CHINA",
        author: "Lizzy Wu",
        content: [
          "It seems contradictory that Mao’s communist policies have been replaced with Deng Xiaoping’s more capitalist ones. While the government is communist, the economy is capitalist, yet the two competing ideologies have historically been so incompatible that a Cold War was born. From our western perspective, we find it difficult to fully understand Chinese economics because we are too focused on trying to slap either a communist or capitalist label on China as a whole. How does China reconcile the two ideologies and why?",
          "Deng Xiaoping looked at the historical success rate of command economies (economies that are controlled completely by the government), and realized that it was ineffectual, inefficient, and costly because no leader or group of leaders can be completely omniscient to know all the market trends from cabbage to shoes. This leads to shortages and surpluses which also leads to social unrest. Capitalist economies on the other hand are the complete opposite (although still very flawed), and dictated by the invisible hand of supply and demand. Because of Mao’s misguided allocation of human resources (telling millions of people to stop work and smelt useless steel in backyards or replacing doctors with high school students), an estimated 15 to 45 million deaths ensued in the Great Leap Forward. This is an example of ineffectual economic policy. In order for China to be a dominant world power, a centralized economy was not the answer, but neither was the overturning of a communist government that so effectively inspires nationalism. Deng Xiaoping came into government with a fresh perspective that contrasted with Mao’s diehard communism. “We mustn't fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries... The very essence of socialism is the liberation and development of the productive systems... Socialism and market economy are not incompatible”"

        title: "Japan",
        author: "Pauline Unietis",
        content: [
          "Many stereotypes about Japan come from the country’s primary media export–anime, which are animated series that span across all genres and are directed at many different age groups. The common anime themes of innovative technology and their focus on kids and teenagers projects an image of Japan as a youthful, technologically advanced society–an image that is absorbed by many foreigners who watch these shows. While Japan is indeed developing new technology rapidly and effectively, the country has been unable to evolve and solve problems in many other areas that desperately need addressing. But what exactly are the problems that are plaguing Japan?",
          "One of the major problems in Japanese society is the working culture. There may be a stereotype from Japanese pop culture that Japan is all fun and games, but in reality, Japanese people work very hard. In Japan, there are salarymen (yes, they’re all men!) who work 16 hour workdays (they come into work at 9 am and go home at 2 am). Outside of working in the office, they are expected to go out and have drinks with their colleagues. The work that they do is often repetitive and boring, and the workplace follows a hierarchy based on age–that is, the older the worker is, the more benefits he receives, so workers are not rewarded based on merit. The overwork and stress caused by the salaryman culture contributes to Japan’s high suicide rates. Salarymen who work 16 hour workdays are vulnerable to feeling lonely and depressed.  Workers are expected to work through their depression by taking medication, and the unwillingness or failure to do so is seen as a sign of unprofessionalism. These workers constantly fear losing their jobs and being excluded by society, since the Japanese people still value lifelong employment.",
          "At the very least, though, salarymen have benefits and more stability in their lives, as they are hired for life after they graduate from college. However, after Japan’s bubble economy burst in the 1990s, Japanese corporations had to let a lot of people go. Japan’s economy has not yet been able to recover to the heights of the 1970s (deemed the high-growth period of Japan). Additionally, the global economy has shifted from a manufacturing based economy to an information based one. These two changes, combined with the system of hiring workers for life, has resulted in Japan’s corporations hiring less and less graduates as permanent workers. As a result, graduates no longer have the stable future that the previous generations once had, and many are forced to turn to temporary jobs. With Japan’s overall value and respect towards lifelong employment, most of these part-time workers are ostracized and plunged into the bottom of society, resulting in a sense of precariousness and hopelessness that may lead to death. In 1998, a total of 32,863 people committed suicide, a 34.7% rise from the previous year’s suicide rate and, at that time, the highest suicide rate Japan has ever seen.",
          "Since Japanese temporary workers are too often deprived of the benefits associated with full-time jobs and are typically not well respected by society, many of them retreat into isolation. Hikikomori are people who isolate themselves in their rooms for at least six months with no interaction beyond their homes. In Japan, there are an estimated 1 million hikikomori. While hikikomori are not a uniquely Japanese phenomenon, many of the factors that are contributing to the rise of hikikomori are distinctly Japanese. These include Japan’s hiring system and the significance of reputation in Japanese culture. Additionally, Japanese parents are reluctant to kick out their hikikomori children because they believe it is the parents’ obligation to properly raise their children.",
          "All of these aspects of Japanese society are contributing to a serious demographics crisis in Japan. As Japanese people are getting more isolated, there are less Japanese young people to support the increasing number of elderly. Less people are getting married, as the youth feel precarious about their future and therefore are unlikely to marry and start a family. Additionally, the work culture prevents real interactions between husbands and wives (husband are not even there for most of daylight).",
          "In conclusion, it is problematic to define Japan based on its cultural exports, as doing so will blind us to Japan’s problems. Even anime itself is contributing to Japan’s increasing isolation, as more and more Japanese people are becoming consumed by the alternate realities created by anime and Japanese culture in general. With Japan’s incoming generation showing clear signs of being less social and less inclined to marry, the promotion of anime may end up fueling Japan’s looming demographic crisis."

          "The Mass Games are a massive acrobatic performance put on by the North Korean government to commemorate major holidays such as the leader’s birthday or the anniversary of North Korea’s independence. Over a hundred thousand North Koreans of all ages from the capital city of Pyongyang spend months training for the games in hopes of their group being picked to perform.",
          "What is fascinating about the mass games is that there is no one star performer. Instead, thousands of individuals perform synchronized movements, creating a larger masterpiece. The performance reflects the North Korean communist belief of putting the group ahead of the individual. In the BBC Documentary “A State of Mind” which follows two girls preparing for the mass games, one of the girls talks about how she continues to train for long hours despite being in pain because she wants to perform for Kim Jong Un and make him proud. Even though Un is often to unable to attend the games, all performers have the same goal of perfecting their act to impress him. This highlights the complete loyalty and deference to their leader that North Koreans hold. These are just some of the traits that make up the North Korean ideology: juche."

          "If North Korean state media is to be believed, the United States is in immediate danger of a North Korean nuclear attack.  North Korea claims to have a miniaturized nuclear warhead and long distance missile, the two aspects required to construct an intercontinental nuclear weapon.  However, those claims are dubiously supported.  In the past decade, North Korea has tested at least four nuclear weapons in underground testing facilities, a practice banned by the United Nations. Following the most recent test, the North Korean government claimed to have successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb, however international experts doubt those claims, attributing the 5.1 magnitude earthquake to a fission explosion, rather than a fussion reaction which carries a much larger detonation.  Similarly, as recently as April 29th, 2016 North Korea announced the testing of mid-range rockets that could be converted to project missiles.  These tests, as well others conducted two weeks earlier were announced as successful by North Korean state media.  However, similar to the reaction to the nuclear tests, other countries contest that none of the missiles actually achieved sustained flight.  Mid-range missiles are a focal point in North Korea’s claim to international security, allowing the target a number of East Asian countries home to thousands of United States military personnel."

	        "North Korea is a confusing player on the global stage.  On one hand, it preaches that it’s nuclear arsenal is simply a “deterrent.”  On the other, it is a country that releases videos of  Seoul and New York in flames.  Many view the North as an erratic country ruled by a dictator, believed to be just over 30 years old, who is treated similarly to a deity in his own country.  This is often attributed to an ignorant population scared for their life and a rudderless regime.  Upon further review, however, the North’s organization and international relationships all tie back to its singular purpose: to unite the Korean peninsula under a single, legitimate government.  North Korean leadership has used the international community to support its cause internally and externally.  Examples include the 1993 incident with the IAEA, where North Korea was condemned for its underground nuclear test and then threatened to quit the treaty.  North Korea takes actions like these to continue to show its citizens and the world that it is still fighting against the imperialism of the west.  WIthout that constant defined conflict, the North would be purposeless, and the continued hardships of citizens would be brought into question.  Now, the daily power outages, food shortages, and unheated homes are blamed on the United States, thus the regime must at least maintain the guise of fighting for their citizens.  They often use international forums to do this without the need for actual conflict, claiming every snub a victory against the west./’"

The North Korean government suppresses any form of opinion or expression that opposes it -- organized political opposition, independent media, free trade unions, and religious activity are prohibited.  To outwardly speak against the government or protest civil rights abuses is to “show insufficient reverence for supreme leader Kim Jong-Un or the ruling Korean Workers’ Party.”  Communication with people outside of North Korea is strictly prohibited; violators face severe penalties.  Torture by officials is common in interrogations during imprisonment. The death penalty can be applied for “vaguely defined offenses such as “crimes against the state” and “crimes against the people.””  Some people charged with serious political offenses are sent to kwan-li-so, which are brutal labor camps that Pyongyang refuses to admit exist. By US and South Korean estimates, between 80,000 and 120,000 people are imprisoned in the four remaining kwan-li-so."

Today about 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.",
          "The relationship between the United States and North Korea, clearly, are far less amicable. There are no diplomatic relationships between the two countries’ governments, and the citizens of both countries tend to think about and understand the other country mainly through stereotypes. We in the United States tend to think of North Korea as a nation of irrational, war mongering leaders and citizens who follow their leader with blind and fanatical devotion. Conversely, hatred of America is a concept which is deeply embedded in North Korean culture. All of these fundamental differences foster animosity and misunderstanding between the two Koreas, making the prospect of reunification, or even peaceful and normalized relations extremely unlikely.  However, K-Pop may be a solution to bridging this gap.",
          "The beginnings of K-Pop stem from the South Korean period of economic growth.  Starting in the 1960s, South Korea began to gradually industrialize and soon became a major economic power by the 1980s.  However, the Asian financial crash of the mid-1990s exposed flaws in the economic system, so the government decided to implement a new strategy in the process of rebuilding the South Korean economy.",
          "Their strategy was cultural technology, which is the process of engineering South Korea’s pop culture to be as successful and appealing as possible. Today, K-Pop is deliberately designed and engineered, to the extent that the idols (the K-Pop stars) are made, not born. Idols are recruited by the entertainment companies, typically during their early teens. Once they agree to become stars and sign contracts, which are typically long term, they undergo intensive training in singing, dancing, foreign languages, and navigating the media. A K-Pop star’s life is highly controlled. Unlike in the United States, even the smallest scandal can completely ruin an artist’s career, so as to prevent any sort of drama, the entertainment companies impose all sorts of regulations on their artists, such as restricted cell phone and social media use and imposition of curfew.",
          "The majority of music and other media is produced by one of three major entertainment companies, which are guided by the government. The content of K-Pop is also very censored. Korea imposes strict regulations with regards to the content of adult themes, drugs, sex, clubbing etc. in their media. For example, when Lady Gaga went on tour in South Korea, tickets to her concerts were only available to people over the age of 19.  This leads to a lot of self-censorship among artists and an overall, juvenile, cutesy theme in K-Pop.  Additionally, K-Pop music is written and produced with an international audience in mind.  This means the music is often based Western electronic or hip-hop, and the dance choreography is largely Western as well.  The lyrics, too, have English interspersed throughout, which serves multiple purposes like drawing English-speaking audiences and making the music seem “cool” and Western.  All of these changes lead to a debate whether K-Pop is actually an authentic part of Korean culture.  Although some of the themes and music in the songs are originally Korean, one could argue that the infusion of Western elements makes K-Pop inherently Western.",
          "Despite these restrictions, K-Pop has become a very successful industry.  In 2011, K-Pop was responsible for $180 million in exports. It has also contributed to an increased interest in Korea and Korean culture internationally, as demonstrated by the  45% increase in U.S. college students studying Korean. K-Pop has also served as a useful political tool to bridge the gap between North and South Korea. Many people in North Korea have grown to love South Korean music and dramas and according to former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun reportedly remarked that hallyu (the increased interest in Korean media) would someday reunify the peninsula. 	",
          "No matter how successful K-Pop will turn out to be in bringing reunification to the two Koreas, there is no doubt that it is a massive cultural force.  K-Pop dictates many of the stereotypes that paint the image that Americans see of South Korea.  However, when watching the bright, bubbly K-Pop music videos, it is still important to remember why K-Pop exists, and to keep in mind that it is not necessarily an authentic representation of Korean culture."
